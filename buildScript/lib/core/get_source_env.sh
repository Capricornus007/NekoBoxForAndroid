# (golang_status hashes this file) invalidates when sing-box changes.

# Human-readable sing-box version for the About screen. Pinned alongside the commit so the
# build does not depend on tags being present in the CI clone (git describe there only
# resolves a bare hash). Update this together with COMMIT_SING_BOX.

# wireguard-go includes the fd-path I/O activity callback API used by newer
# sing-quic/quic-go integrations. This fork branch also fixes the callback to
# count only successful sends.
